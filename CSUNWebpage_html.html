      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a student at California State University, Northridge, studying Computer Science.
        I became interested in the Major in high school after attending a CyberPatriot competition, 
        I didn't go very far. I hope to learn more about networks to enter the cyber security field.
        I also enjoy open world video games and really enjoy watching rally racing. I would like to 
        build a sim-rig to learn technical driving skills one day.
